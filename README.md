## Getting Started

The application is divided into two main sections: **Servers** and **Worlds**. Both require the world or server to have its respective **Addon** installed.

## 🌍 Mode: Worlds (P2P)

Ideal for playing with friends in local worlds via direct connection.

### For the Host:
1. Go to the **Worlds** tab and select the **My World** option.

   > * In your Minecraft **Profile** settings, the **"Enable WebSocket"** option must be toggled on.

### For Guests:

## 🖥️ Mode: Servers

Configuration for communities and dedicated servers.

1. Go to the **Servers** tab and press the add button.
2. Enter the **IP** and **Port** of the server you wish to connect to.
3. Upon entering the server room, all members will see a **Link** at the top.
4. **Activation:** Only **one user** needs to copy the link and paste the command into the Minecraft server chat.
   * By doing this, all other users in the room will connect automatically.
   * *Note:* If all players leave the server, the first one to re-enter must run the command again.
   * **Key Difference:** In this mode, it is **not necessary** to enable WebSockets in your Minecraft profile.
